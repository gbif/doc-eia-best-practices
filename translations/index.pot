"The IPT is the most commonly-used tool and is maintained and developed by "
"the GBIF Secretariat. IPTs can generate a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A), the "
"preferred exchange format, for each dataset and register them on GBIF. To "
"use the IPT, data must already be digitized.  Acceptable file types include "
"delimited text files (e.g. text files using comma or tab-separated values) "
"or Microsoft Excel. Database connections can also be made. If the IPT is to "
"be hosted within the publishing institution, upon installation of the IPT, "
"the publishing organization should register as the host. If the IPT is "
"hosted elsewhere, the IPT administrator can add the publishing organization "
"to the IPT using an IPT token that is issued upon endorsement of the "
"publisher."

"To share data through GBIF.org, publishers must collate or transform and "
"describe existing datasets into a "
"https://www.gbif.org/standards[standardized format^]. This work may require "
"additional processing, content editing and mapping the content of a dataset "
"into one of the available formats. Publishers thus play an essential role "
"not simply in sharing datasets, but also in managing their quality, "
"completeness and usefulness as well as ensuring their integration and value "
"within GBIF’s global knowledge base. GBIF provides guidance on the "
"https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements[data quality requirements and "
"recommendations^]. The https://www.gbif.org/tools/data-validator[GBIF Data "
"Validator^] is a tool that lets publishers check datasets prior to "

"cleaned by flagging, for example, duplicate identifiers, incomplete fields "
"and recognized inconsistencies in formatting."
